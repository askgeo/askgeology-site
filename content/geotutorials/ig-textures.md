Igneous Petrology is the study of rocks and minerals formed through the crystallization of magma. Some of these rocks form from volcanic activity, others form deep within the crust and are later revealed through weathering of the surrounding rock. 

Many igneous rocks are composed of a few common minerals, which can be seen in thin section below, and are described as either felsic or mafic depending on their composition and color. Mafic minerals (Magnesium + ferrous iron, relatively dark in color) include olivine, pyroxene, biotite, amphibole, and others. Felsic (feldspar + silica, relatively light in color) minerals include quartz, muscovite mica, orthoclase feldspar, and others. Rarer minerals which often accompany these are known as accessory minerals.

## Mafic Minerals
**Olivine -**
The mineral which also makes up the most of ultramafic rocks, such as the deep-mantle peridotites, olivine may be found in many basalts (mafic extrusive igneous rock) and has a characteristic high relief and fractures in thin section.

**Pyroxene -**
May take the form of either orthopyroxene or clinopyroxene, which are differentiated based on their birefringence and extinction in thin section (clinopyroxene has inclined extinction).

**Amphibole-**
Where visible, the strong coloration and 60/120 degree cleavage are characteristic for identifying amphibole in thin section.

**Biotite-**
Look for characteristic low relief, strong coloration (yellowish or reddish brown), pleochroism in plane-polarized light, pebbly "bird's-eye" extinction in cross polarized light, and basal cleavage.

## Felsic Minerals
**Potassium Feldspar -**
"K-spar" variety microcline is very easy to identify in cross-polars due to the "tartan" twinning, which looks like woven plaid. Microcline twin faces often appear less sharply edged than plagioclase twin faces.

**Muscovite - **
Muscovite shows low relief, basal cleavage, high birefringence, "bird's-eye" extinction patterns, and may be associated with biotite.

**Quartz - **
Quartz appears colorless in plane-polarized light and has very low birefringence in cross-polarized light, with low relief. Also often shows undualotry extinction in cross-polars where the grain underwent strain.

## Other Minerals

**Plagioclase Feldspar -**
May be mafic or felsic, depending on the variety. Plagioclase feldspar is a very important mineral in felsic, intermediate, and mafic rocks, making up to 70% of some (as in the case of diorites and andesites). In felsic rocks, plagioclase will contain more sodium (NaAlSi3O8 - albite being the purest example), while mafic rocks will show more calcium-rich plagioclase (as in CaAl2Si2O8 - anorthite).

**Alteration Minerals -**
Minerals which result from weathering, metamorphism, or other processes which transform one mineral to another. Very commonly the alteration will be partial, and will be seen as halo/borders surrounding, or patches within, a mineral in thin section.

**Oxides -**
Minerals which are composed of oxygen and metal alloys may be found in igneous rocks, and may make up important economic deposits, as in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.
