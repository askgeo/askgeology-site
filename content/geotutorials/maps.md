# Maps and Compasses

Geologists use compasses called "Brunton compasses" in order to measure and then describe the orientation of a plane in space. This helps geologists to map rock formations, minerals, and features such as faults. The orientation is recorded as **strike** and **dip**, which is then often notated in a 2D map.

The compasses give us the cardinal direction in degrees, as well as the amount that the compass is tilted. This tilt is known as the dip, and can be seen below:

The map direction that the dip is tilting towards is the strike. See the very useful youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzZFMWH-lSQ) for a great explanation of this concept.

Geologic maps use symbols to portray this strike and dip information on each rock formation, which allows the geologist to "think in 3D" and visualize, or sketch, the geologic structures beneath the Earth's surface.

These symbols may be difficult to understand initially, but they are meant to represent some fairly complex structures in 3D, on a 2D image. Check out this website for an excellent overview of various structures-- such as **faults** and **folds**-- that the geologic map represents.
