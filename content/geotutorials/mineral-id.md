# Mineral Identification

The identification of rocks and minerals allows the geologist to determine the properties of a rock formation, such as physical stability, potential to serve as an aquifer, likelihood of ore deposits, or the order of events in the local natural history.

Rock identification can be accomplished first by identifying the constituent minerals, and then the textures present. The minerals may be large and euhedral (perfectly formed crystals), or small and difficult to see with the naked eye. For this reason, it is easiest to begin with a solid foundation in mineral identification before adding the rocks, fossils, geologic structures, or more complex topics.

Minerals are inorganic, naturally forming solids with a regular internal structure and a definite chemical formula. Because of these defining characteristics, each mineral has predictable physical properties, such as hardness, smell, or behavior when broken. These are the most important physical properties to know:

## Color

The color of a mineral can be incredibly helpful or completely deceptive. For this reason, I suggest that color never be the only property considered in an ID. For example, the mineral quartz, one of the most common minerals on the Earth's surface, can be purple, yellow, orange, brown, white, and colorless, and sometimes green, blue, or even red. However, do note that minerals can be defined based on whether they are very light or very dark (see Felsic, Mafic).

Quartz varieties can be very different in color and even opacity.

## Hardness

Hardness is the mineral's resistance to being scratched. It is measured from 1-10 on the Moh's Scale which is defined by minerals of given relative hardness. Talc is the definitive mineral for Moh's hardness of 1, and diamond defines a 10. You can easily determine hardness by scratching the mineral (if destructive tests are allowed) with a penny, steel nail, fingernail, or piece of mineral whose hardness you know.

## Streak

Streak is the color of the mineral when powdered. You may determine streak color may scraping the mineral firmly across a cermaic plate, but the mineral must be softer than the plate, or it will simply scratch it without streaking. A helpful guideline for streaks: metallic minerals often have telltale streak color, while nonmetallic minerals often simply streak white.

Hematite will show two different streaks depending on the oxidation state.

## Luster

The simplest way to define a mineral's luster is as either metallic or non metallic. If the mineral is opaque and looks like it is made from metal, it is called metallic. Nonmetallic lusters describe all other minerals. More specifically, nonmetallic minerals can be greasy, resinous, adamantine, waxy, pearly, glassy, and so on.

Hematite will also show different lusters depending on the oxidation state. The hematite on the left is

metallic, while the hematite on the right is nonmetallic and could be described as having an dull luster.

## Cleavage

Cleavage is the mineral's preferential planes of weakness, at which it will cleave or split along when broken. See below for an in depth discussion.

## Fracture

A mineral which does not have cleavage will have a fracture when broken, which will be described as irregular, conchoidal, hackly, earthy, etc. Some common examples are kaolin, which has an earthy fracture, and quartz, which has a conchoidal fracture. Glass, which is not a mineral, also breaks conchoidally, as well as the rocks obsidian and chert. See these examples of conchoidal fracture, which show the classic "seashell" pattern of the broken edge to varying degrees:

The obsidian on the left and the glass on the right both show a conchoidal fracture, as does quartz.

## Others

There are other very useful properties which certain minerals can easily be identified by. For instance, magnetite is magnetic. Calcite will effervesce (fizz or bubble) when acid is applied to its surface. Kaolin has an earthy smell when moistened with breath, and sulfur has a constant, easily recognizable odor. Certain minerals fluoresce when illuminated by blacklight. Halite, the mineral from which table salt is produced, tastes salty. These are additional properties that can help if you are close to narrowing a mineral ID down. 

## Cleavage - How to determine if there is cleavage, how many planes, and at what angles?

As mentioned above, cleavage is the plane or planes of weakness within the structure of a mineral. Let's look at the atomic structure of halite (NaCl), which is table salt, and a common variety of quartz:

The mineral on the left has atoms arranged in a 3-D grid, locked together by bonds at right angles. In order to cut through this grid, it would be easiest to find the "grain" of the structure, or the place where it is weakest, just like when cutting a presliced bagel in half.  The mineral on the right has no easy path for a knife to cut straight through-- no real "grain".

The mineral muscovite (a mica) has cleavage in only one direction. 

Let's look at another example. In the mineral above, the atoms are arranged in a sandwich. Would it be easier to slice or break the mineral between the "bread", or through both "bread slices"? This mineral is a mica, and the easiest way to slice or break this mineral is parallel to the slices. These planes between the slices are all oriented in the same direction, and there is only one direction. We call this direction the cleavage. 

It might help to lay your hand flat in the direction of the cleavage(s) of a mineral to try to visualize it.
