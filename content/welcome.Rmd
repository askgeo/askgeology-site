## Abigail S. Knapp' Geology Hub

Welcome! I am a hydrogeologist and an active educator in geoscience through outreach and teaching.

See [Research](/research/) for my past projects and [Geotutor](/geotutor/) for teaching resources.

## Hydrogeology + Decision Tools + Earth Science Outreach

Please see my [CV](doc/AbigailKnapp_CVFull_2021.pdf) and [Teaching Philosophy](/doc/ASKnapp_TeachingPhilosophyStatement.pdf/).

I am interested in ecohydrogeology, or the hydrologic and landscape drivers of ecological change under the pressures of a warming climate and changing land use.

So far, I have completed a B.S. in Geology and an M.S. in Geology with a focus on hydrology. I have also worked in the public sector in wastewater permitting and Underground Injection Control at the State level.

Currently, I am pursuing research in changing soil carbon cycles, as increased drought, precipitation, and thaw are changing the rates of carbon retention or release into streams and lakes.

Please reach out via [email](abigail.s.knapp@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
