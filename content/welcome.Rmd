Welcome! I am a hydrogeologist and an active educator in geoscience through outreach and teaching.

See [Research](/research/) for my past projects and [Geotutor](/geotutor/) for teaching resources.

## About Abigail

**Hydrogeology + Decision Tools + Earth Science Outreach**

I am a geologist interested in ecohydrogeology, or the hydrologic and landscape drivers of ecological change under the pressures of a warming climate and changing land use.

I am pursuing research in changing soil carbon cycles, as increased drought, precipitation, and thaw are changing the rates of carbon retention or release into streams and lakes.
