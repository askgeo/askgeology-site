<p>Welcome! I am a hydrogeologist and an active educator in geoscience through outreach and teaching.</p>
<p>See <a href="/research/">Research</a> for my past projects and <a href="/geotutor/">Geotutor</a> for teaching resources.</p>

<h2>Hydrogeology + Decision Tools + Earth Science Outreach</h2>
<p>Please see my <a href="doc/AbigailKnapp_CVFull_2021.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="/doc/ASKnapp_TeachingPhilosophyStatement.pdf/">Teaching Philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>I am interested in ecohydrogeology, or the hydrologic and landscape drivers of ecological change under the pressures of a warming climate and changing land use.</p>
<p>So far, I have completed a B.S. in Geology and an M.S. in Geology with a focus on hydrology. I have also worked in the public sector in wastewater permitting and Underground Injection Control at the State level.</p>
<p>Currently, I am pursuing research in changing soil carbon cycles, as increased drought, precipitation, and thaw are changing the rates of carbon retention or release into streams and lakes.</p>
<p>Please reach out via <a href="abigail.s.knapp@gmail.com">email</a> if you have any questions.</p>
