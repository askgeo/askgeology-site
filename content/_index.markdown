# ASKGEOLOGY

## _Abigail S. Knapp' Geology Hub_

**Welcome!** I am a hydrogeologist interested in how physical hydrology affects ecosystem health. I am also an active educator in geoscience through outreach and teaching..

See [Research](/research/) for my past projects and [Geotutor](/geotutor/) for teaching resources.
