# Mineral Identification

The identification of rocks and minerals allows the geologist to determine the properties of a rock formation, such as physical stability, potential to serve as an aquifer, likelihood of ore deposits, or the order of events in the local natural history.

Rock identification can be accomplished first by identifying the constituent minerals, and then the textures present. The minerals may be large and euhedral (perfectly formed crystals), or small and difficult to see with the naked eye. For this reason, it is easiest to begin with a solid foundation in mineral identification before adding the rocks, fossils, geologic structures, or more complex topics.
