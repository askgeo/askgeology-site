# ASKGeology Website

## A Hub for Geology and Teaching Resources, created in Rmarkdown

### Hello!

If you've found your way here, you must be really interested in static websites, geoscience pedagogy, free teaching materials, or perhaps you've got some extra free time!

This repo is how I deploy updates to my personal website for geology and teaching. More updates and a domain change to askgeology.com to come.

### Feature wishlist:
- Photo gallery
- Custom theme
- Transfer blog posts

### Websites can be made in R?

Yes! This website was made using R, Rstudio, Rmarkdown, and the packages below and with Git, Github, and Netlify for version control and hosting.
**Packages:**
